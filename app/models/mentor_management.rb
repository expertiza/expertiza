class MentorManagement
  # Select a mentor using the following algorithm
  #
  # 1) Find all assignment participants for the
  #    assignment with id [assignment_id] whose
  #    duty is the same as [Particpant#DUTY_MENTOR].
  # 2) Count the number of teams those participants
  #    are a part of, acting as a proxy for the
  #    number of teams they mentor.
  # 3) Return the mentor with the fewest number of
  #    teams they're currently mentoring.
  #
  # This method's runtime is O(n lg n) due to the call to
  # Hash#sort_by. This assertion assumes that the
  # database management system is capable of fetching the
  # required rows at least as quickly.
  #
  # Implementation detail: Any tie between the top 2
  # mentors is decided by the Hash#sort_by algorithm.
  #
  # @return The id of the mentor with the fewest teams
  #   they are assigned to. Returns `nil` if there are
  #   no participants with mentor duty for [assignment_id].

  # E2115: Handles calls when an assignment has the auto_assign_mentor flag enabled and triggered by the event when a new member joins an assignment team.
  #
  # This event happens when:
  #   1.) An invited student user accepts and successfully added to a team from
  #       app/models/invitation.rb
  #   2.) A student user is successfully added to the team manually from
  #       app/controllers/teams_users_controller.rb.
  #
  # This method will determine if a mentor needs to be assigned, if so,
  # selects one, and adds the mentor to the team if:
  #   1.) The assignment does not have a topic.
  #   2.) If the team has reached >50% full capacity.
  #   3.) If the team does not have a mentor.
