The way to call this method

  # The original gale shapley implementation had the following method signature:
  # def gale_shapley(users, user_size, item_size)
  # However, we have changed it to:

    Description
    -----------
    Given the users preference towards items, the available slots of each item and
    maximum number each user can have items, assign items to users according to their preference.

    -----------
    users       :   List[dict]
        dict format: {"pid": user_id, "ranks": [item_id]} the most interested items go first.
