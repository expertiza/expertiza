# Capistrano Recipes for managing delayed_job
#
# Add these callbacks to have the delayed_job process restart when the server
# is restarted:
#
#   after "deploy:stop",    "delayed_job:stop"
#   after "deploy:start",   "delayed_job:start"
#   after "deploy:restart", "delayed_job:restart"
#
# If you want to use command line options, for example to start multiple workers,
# define a Capistrano variable delayed_job_args:
#
#   set :delayed_jobs_args, "-n 2"
#
# If you've got delayed_job workers running on a servers, you can also specify
# which servers have delayed_job running and should be restarted after deploy.
#
#   set :delayed_job_server_role, :worker
#
