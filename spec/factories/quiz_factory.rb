# This file defines factory methods that are functionally related
# to the Expertiza quiz feature. Factories can be used to create
# objects unique to quizzes, including:
#   QuizQuestionnaire
#   QuizQuestion
#   QuizQuestionChoice
#   QuizResponseMap
#   QuizResponse
#   Answer
#
# Note that many of these classes are subclasses specializing
# in quizzing and that the superclasses have a winder purpose.
# Additionally, objects that are not unique to quizzing but
# which show up in the relationships can be found in
# factories.rb.
