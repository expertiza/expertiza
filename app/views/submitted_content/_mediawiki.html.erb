<!--The following checks a wiki type.  If we add a new wiki type, we need to modify this code, which is in
a very unexpected place.  This should be done by polymorphism, based on a Wiki class that is subclassed
for various kinds of wikis.

Make a generic review_wiki function, with a parameter specifying wiki type.  The review_wiki function
then makes callbacks to the various wiki classes, depending on what kind of a wiki it is working on.
This allows wiki-specific behavior to be kept in the wiki classes. -->
