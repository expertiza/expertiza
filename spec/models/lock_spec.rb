# This test was added for E1973:
# http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2019_-_Project_E1973._Team_Based_Reviewing
# For this project, it was only necessary that responses be locked. If you plan on using Lock for another model,
# You should add cases for that model to this test.
