1. Add new deadline types:



$  script/generate migration create_new_deadline_types
go to db/migrate, modify the newly created migration file as follows:

class CreateNewDeadlineTypes < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def self.up
        DeadlineType.create :name => "signup"
        DeadlineType.create :name => "team_formation"
  end

  def self.down
        DeadlineType.find_by_name("signup").destroy
        DeadlineType.find_by_name("team_formation").destroy
  end
end



2.To install delayed_job as a plugin:
Run:
>script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job.git -r v2.0

Back-end: delayed job uses table delayed_job. so create one.
$ script/generate delayed_job
$ rake db:migrate
