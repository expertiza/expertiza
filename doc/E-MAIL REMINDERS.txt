E-mail Reminders
================

Database:
=========
* db/migrate/125_add_flag_thre_to_due_dates.rb - file 125_add_flag_thre_to_due_dates.rb was added to the specified path

* db/schema.rb - addition of a Flag to the due_dates table to indicate if the e-mail for the particular due date has been sent and a Threshold Time to indicate how long before the due date to send the e-mail.

Views:
=====
* views/assignmentdue_dates.rhtml & views/assignment/edit.rhtml - addition of the Reminder drop down to allow adjusting the number of hours before the deadline to send the e-mail.

Model:
=====
* assignment.rb (in models/) - Added three methods: get_current_due_date(), get_next_due_date(), find_next_stage() 

* due_date.rb (in models/) - Added one method: setFlag() - set the due date flag in database to "true"(1)


Initialization:
==============
* development.rb - Added a "config.after_initialize" statement to initialize our background thread when the server starts.


Plugin:
=======
* vendor/plugins/spawn plugin - Used for creating threads and for initializing the current

This spawn plugin adds the capability to the system to create seperate running threads.  In our system we have created a single background thread that runs every hour to check for assignments that require e-mails to be sent.  This thread is initialized to truely be a background thread in that it runs at a lower priority so it won't bog down the system if it encounters a large number of e-mails to send.  (Though we were unable to verify this).  The background thread is run from the file spawnhelper.rb which is located in the spawn plug-in folder.  

Config:
======
* Addition of a piece of code to config/environment.rb file to configure the port and domain for sending emails.
