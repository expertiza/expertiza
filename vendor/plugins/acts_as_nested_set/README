ActsAsNestedSet
==============

This acts_as extension provides Nested Set functionality.  Nested Set is similiar to Tree, but with the added feature that you can select the children and all of their descendents with a single query.  A good use case for this is a threaded post system, where you want to display every reply to a comment without multiple selects.


Example
=======

  class Product < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set
  end
