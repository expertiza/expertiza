Morpher Examples
================

These are some random examples I captured on parings.
At this early stage the examples are very "unimpressive" and only scratch the surface.

The examples are used for parings to show API in action under IRB:

```
cd morpher
bundle exec irb -I lib -r ./examples/your_example.rb
# Now access the constants defined in example to play with the evaluators
```
