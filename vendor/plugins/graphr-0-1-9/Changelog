2001-11-16, RF
	* Released 0.1.9
	* Added DirectedGraph#strongly_connected_components and
	  DirectedGraph#num_vertices with tests, all written by Tanaka Akira.
	  Thanks Tanaka-san! (Or is it Akira-san?)
	* Released 0.1.8
	* Added test that negative hash values are never used in
	  node names. Dot can't handle them.
	* Released 0.1.7
	* Added "n" char in front of the node names so that they can
	  be used in well-formed XML docs (nums not allowed in first char).
	  Thanks to Tobias Reif for this one.
	* Extended example in README to show how URL's can be added to nodes.

	* Use hash value as node number in dot files instead of id value,
	  since the latter is not the same for strings even though they
	  are equal.
	* Added node attributes in the same way as edge attributes.
	
2001-10-26, RF
	* Released as 0.1.3.
	* Redesign. Skipped DotGraph and DotGraphFormatter class and moved 
	  everything to new class DotGRaphPrinter.
	* Size does not have a default value so dot uses its default.
	* Default value for orientation is "porttrait" which fits most
	  image output formats (except postscript!).

2001-10-26, RF
	* Release 0.1.2
	* Added DotGraphFormatter#set_edge_attributes
	* Added unit tests for DotGraphFormatter
	* Added accessors to DotGraphFormatter for orientation and size 
	* Added this Changelog
