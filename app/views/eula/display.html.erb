<p>I understand that my homework submissions and reviews will be  
stored on a server at NC State University.  The software restricts  
access to review data so that only I, my instructor, teaching  
assistant (if any), and reviewers can see it.  However, I understand  
that, in the unlikely event of a server breach, this data could be  
disclosed to others.</p>
