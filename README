E320. Collect data about a student in one place

The issue here is that one of our instructors wants to be able see all of the information on a student in one place ÎíÎõ this includes the studentÎéÎ÷s submissions, reviews, author feedback (to and from), teammate evaluations, and metareviews.  I would add that one should be able to see any of these items for the student for all assignments in the semester in one place.
