E1480 - Test the student interface

This project focused on writing tests using Capybara and Rspec to test the
student interface. That is these tests are integration tests and therefore
the tests will all be modeled from the perspective of the student user.

In order to run the tests:
After pulling in the new changes run bundle install.
Make sure that the database is in good order:
    rake db:drop
    rake db:reset
    rake db:reset RAILS_ENV=test

Run the tests:
rspec -fd
