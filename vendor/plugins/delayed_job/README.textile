h1. Delayed::Job

Delated_job (or DJ) encapsulates the common pattern of asynchronously executing longer tasks in the background.

It is a direct extraction from Shopify where the job table is responsible for a multitude of core tasks. Amongst those tasks are:

* sending massive newsletters
* image resizing
* http downloads
* updating smart collections
* updating solr, our search server, after product changes
* batch imports
* spam checks

h2. Installation

This version is for Rails 2.x only.  For rails 3 support, install delayed_job 2.1.

To install as a gem, add the following to @config/environment.rb@:

<pre>
config.gem 'delayed_job', :version => '~>2.0.4'
</pre>

Rake tasks are not automatically loaded from gems, so you'll need to add the following to your Rakefile:

<pre>
begin
  gem 'delayed_job', '~>2.0.4'
  require 'delayed/tasks'
rescue LoadError
  STDERR.puts "Run `rake gems:install` to install delayed_job"
end
</pre>

To install as a plugin:

<pre>
script/plugin install git://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job.git -r v2.0
</pre>

After delayed_job is installed, you will need to setup the backend.

h3. Dependencies

delayed_job depends upon version 1.0.10 of the daemons gem. delayed_job is incompatible with the newest (1.1.0) daemons gem.

h2. Backends

delayed_job supports multiple backends for storing the job queue. There are currently implementations for Active Record, MongoMapper, and DataMapper.

h3. Active Record

The default is Active Record, which requires a jobs table.

<pre>
$ script/generate delayed_job
$ rake db:migrate
</pre>

h3. MongoMapper

You must use @MongoMapper.setup@ in the initializer:

<pre>
config = YAML::load(File.read(Rails.root.join('config/mongo.yml')))
MongoMapper.setup(config, Rails.env)

Delayed::Worker.backend = :mongo_mapper
</pre>

h3. DataMapper

<pre>
# config/initializers/delayed_job.rb
Delayed::Worker.backend = :data_mapper
Delayed::Worker.backend.auto_upgrade!
</pre>

h2. Queuing Jobs

Call @.delay.method(params)@ on any object and it will be processed in the background.

<pre>
# without delayed_job
Notifier.deliver_signup(@user)

# with delayed_job
Notifier.delay.deliver_signup @user
</pre>

If a method should always be run in the background, you can call @#handle_asynchronously@ after the method declaration:

<pre>
class Device
  def deliver
    # long running method
  end
  handle_asynchronously :deliver
end

device = Device.new
device.deliver
</pre>

handle_asynchronously can take as options anything you can pass to delay. In addition the values can be Proc objects allowing call time evaluation of the value. For some examples:

<pre>
class LongTasks
  def send_mailer
    # Some other code
  end
  handle_asynchronously :send_mailer, :priority => 20

  def in_the_future
    # Some other code
  end
  # 5.minutes.from_now will be evaluated when in_the_future is called
  handle_asynchronously :in_the_future, :run_at => Proc.new { 5.minutes.from_now }

  def self.when_to_run
    2.hours.from_now
  end

  def call_a_class_method
    # Some other code
  end
  handle_asynchronously :call_a_class_method, :run_at => Proc.new { when_to_run }

  attr_reader :how_important

  def call_an_instance_method
    # Some other code
  end
  handle_asynchronously :call_an_instance_method, :priority => Proc.new {|i| i.how_important }
end
</pre>

h2. Running Jobs

@script/delayed_job@ can be used to manage a background process which will start working off jobs.  Make sure you've run `script/generate delayed_job`.

<pre>
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job start
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job stop

# Runs two workers in separate processes.
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job -n 2 start
$ RAILS_ENV=production script/delayed_job stop
</pre>

Workers can be running on any computer, as long as they have access to the database and their clock is in sync. Keep in mind that each worker will check the database at least every 5 seconds.

You can also invoke @rake jobs:work@ which will start working off jobs. You can cancel the rake task with @CTRL-C@.

h2. Custom Jobs

Jobs are simple ruby objects with a method called perform. Any object which responds to perform can be stuffed into the jobs table. Job objects are serialized to yaml so that they can later be resurrected by the job runner.

<pre>
class NewsletterJob < Struct.new(:text, :emails)
  def perform
    emails.each { |e| NewsletterMailer.deliver_text_to_email(text, e) }
  end
end

Delayed::Job.enqueue NewsletterJob.new('lorem ipsum...', Customers.find(:all).collect(&:email))
</pre>

You can also add an optional on_permanent_failure method which will run if the job has failed too many times to be retried:

<pre>
class ParanoidNewsletterJob < NewsletterJob
  def perform
    emails.each { |e| NewsletterMailer.deliver_text_to_email(text, e) }
  end

  def on_permanent_failure
    page_sysadmin_in_the_middle_of_the_night
  end
end
</pre>

h2. Gory Details

The library evolves around a delayed_jobs table which looks as follows:

<pre>
create_table :delayed_jobs, :force => true do |table|
  table.integer  :priority, :default => 0      # Allows some jobs to jump to the front of the queue
  table.integer  :attempts, :default => 0      # Provides for retries, but still fail eventually.
  table.text     :handler                      # YAML-encoded string of the object that will do work
  table.text   :last_error                   # reason for last failure (See Note below)
  table.datetime :run_at                       # When to run. Could be Time.zone.now for immediately, or sometime in the future.
  table.datetime :locked_at                    # Set when a client is working on this object
  table.datetime :failed_at                    # Set when all retries have failed (actually, by default, the record is deleted instead)
  table.string   :locked_by                    # Who is working on this object (if locked)
  table.timestamps
end
</pre>

On failure, the job is scheduled again in 5 seconds + N ** 4, where N is the number of retries.

The default Worker.max_attempts is 25. After this, the job either deleted (default), or left in the database with "failed_at" set.
With the default of 25 attempts, the last retry will be 20 days later, with the last interval being almost 100 hours.

The default Worker.max_run_time is 4.hours. If your job takes longer than that, another computer could pick it up. It's up to you to
make sure your job doesn't exceed this time. You should set this to the longest time you think the job could take.

By default, it will delete failed jobs (and it always deletes successful jobs). If you want to keep failed jobs, set
Delayed::Worker.destroy_failed_jobs = false. The failed jobs will be marked with non-null failed_at.

Here is an example of changing job parameters in Rails:

<pre>
# config/initializers/delayed_job_config.rb
Delayed::Worker.destroy_failed_jobs = false
Delayed::Worker.sleep_delay = 60
Delayed::Worker.max_attempts = 3
Delayed::Worker.max_run_time = 5.minutes
</pre>

h3. Cleaning up

You can invoke @rake jobs:clear@ to delete all jobs in the queue.
