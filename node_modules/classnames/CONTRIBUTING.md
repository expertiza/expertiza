Thanks for your interest in classNames. Issues, PRs and suggestions welcome :)

Before working on a PR, please consider the following:

* Speed is a serious concern for this package as it is likely to be called a
significant number of times in any project that uses it. As such, new features
will only be accepted if they improve (or at least do not negatively impact)
performance.
* To demonstrate performance differences please set up a
[JSPerf](http://jsperf.com) test and link to it from your issue / PR.
* Tests must be added for any change or new feature before it will be accepted.
