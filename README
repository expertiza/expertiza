E207 - Questionnaires and advice
--------------------------------

This project requires 
	- Advice has its own MVC
	- Certain methods are moved to helper class
	- Advice should be set while creating questionnaire
	

Changes
-------
Changes made are as follows:

1. questionnaire_controller.rb:
	a. "copy" method was moved from this controller to app\helpers\questionnaire_helper.rb. All references to this method were changed.
	b. The methods concerning "advice" were removed from this controller.
	
2. question_advice_controller.rb:
	a. New controller to handle advice was created.
	b. Corresponding views were also created.
	c. Methods concerning advice like saving advice and editing advice can be found in this controller.
	
3. There was no option to create advice while creating the questionnaire itself. This has been included. When the questionnaire is created. once the questions are set, it is redirected to a page where advice can be set.

Clarifications
--------------
1. There are few methods used to save questions (which are a part of the questionnaire). These methods are still a part of questionnaire controller since they form the basis of questionnaires.
2. Saving advice functionality was not working previously and we have raised a support case with expertiza support.
3. Right now the only questionnaires that are present are the various kinds of reviews and surveys. This functionality still remains.

	
Existing bugs
-------------
Saving advice does not work, it always saves a blank advice.
This bug is already existing in expertiza, and is not a part of the requirements for this project.
However, we are working on resolving this.
