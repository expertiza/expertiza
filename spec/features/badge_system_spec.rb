    # WE NEED SOME WAY TO ADD THESE TO THE ASSIGNMENTS:
    # PARTICIPANTS,
    # TEAMS,
    # REVIEW SCORES,
    # TEAMMATE REVIEW SCORES <-- * this may not have a factory method

    # IF WE CAN DO THAT, WE MAY BE ABLE TO "LOG IN" AS THE INSTRUCTOR
    # IN ORDER TO ALTER THE REVIEW SCORES FOR THE TESTS

    # WE ALSO MAY BE ABLE TO "LOG IN" AS THE PARTICIPANTS
    # IN ORDER TO ALTER THE TEAMMATE REVIEWS FOR THE TESTS

    # THERE MAY BE SOME OTHER (BETTER) WAY TO TEST THIS, I AM NOT SURE

    # **********

    # Ok, so the factories are making a little more sense to me.

    # Check out the following methods in the factories.rb file:

    # :student
    # :course
    # :assignment
    # :assignment_team
    # :team_user
    # :participant
    # :review_grade

    # I think we will need to write one for a TeammateReviewReponseMap, maybe?
