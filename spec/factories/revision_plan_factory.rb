# This file defines factory methods that are functionally related
# to the Expertiza revision plan feature. Factories can be used to create
# objects unique to revision plans, including:
#   RevisionPlanQuestionnaire
#   RevisionPlanTeamMap
#
# Note that many of these classes are subclasses specializing
# in revision planning and that the superclasses have a winder purpose.
# Additionally, objects that are not unique to revision planning but
# which show up in the relationships can be found in
# factories.rb.
