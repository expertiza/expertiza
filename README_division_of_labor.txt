E1656 Division of Labor

Issues that originally work: Issue 719, Issue 328, issue 183.

Extra issue: 
Create a way to export a list of teams that have signed up for topics, and who are waitlisted for topics, as well as participants in an assignment who have not signed up for topics. Choose the format, but keep it as consistent as possible with the other export formats. This would help the professor when students ask him for advice on finding teammates.
