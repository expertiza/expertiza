# This class was added to facilitate functionality in E1973:
# http://wiki.expertiza.ncsu.edu/index.php/CSC/ECE_517_Fall_2019_-_Project_E1973._Team_Based_Reviewing
# But was generalized at the behest of Dr. Gehringer.
# The purpose of this model is to help facilitate the locking of edits of models, or more specifically,
# To facilitate the locking of the pages which allow for modification of an object.
# Because this was made for that purpose, ActiveRecord.lock! is not used on the resource. However, it may be useful
# for you if you wish to use this to implement a lock just on a database entry.
# There is information here: https://api.rubyonrails.org/v5.2.3/classes/ActiveRecord/Locking/Pessimistic.html

  # Requests a lock on the given resource for the given user
  # Since resources can be of any class, the class name for the resource must be provided
  # Return the resource if it's available or nil if it is not
  # Automatically handles creating/destroying locks and timeout periods
  # However, once a user is done with a lock, it is their responsibility to destroy it by using Lock.unlock

  # If I am a user who uses a resource for so long that the timeout period has passed AND another
  # user has locked, modified, and unlocked the resource, I do NOT want to modify the resource
  # even though it may be unlocked. This method should always be checked before any database
  # changes are made.
  # It should be noted that this will return true even after the timeout period has passed.
  # Since this method is for doing safety checks, if no one else has acquired the lock, it's okay to
  # make edits.
  # This method will also renew the timeout period on the lock to avoid race conditions
